ZedGraph Class Library Revision History

11-Dec-2005 (by Champion)
[NEW] Add Fill.RangeDefault

8-Dec-2005 (by Champion)
[FIX] Make cross logic work properly for isScaleLabels inside on secondary axes
[NEW] Add AxisGap property to control space between secondary axes

7-Dec-2005 (by Champion)
[FIX] Make stack bar & stack line work with non-ordinal axes

29-Nov-2005 (by Champion)
[NEW] Add IsEnableVZoom and IsEnableHZoom to constrain zoom in ZedGraphControl
[NEW] Add implicit float cast in XDate

24-Nov-2005 (by softlion, concern the webcontrol only)
[FIX] major bug, positioning of graph items was not working at all. Action: removed X1 and Y1 (redundant, described as alias of X and Y). Their 0 value were overriding the original X and Y values.
[UPD] Renamed AxisFill to GraphFill, AxisBorder to GraphBorder, AxisRect to GraphRect so axis and graph space becomes two correctly separated things.
[NEW] MasterPaneFill and MasterPaneBorder properties
[NEW] Transparency is shown as squares in the designer.
[REM] PNG transparency is supported in FireFox. To get it also in IE6 or less, you must use the IE7 javascript http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/ like this:
	<script>
	window.IE7_PNG_SUFFIX = "\\.png(?:\\?.*?)";
	</script>
	<script src="ie7/ie7-standard-p.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

23-Nov-2005 (by Champion)
[FIX] Ten Power placement for scale labels
[FIX] ShowPointValues with Text Axes and IsOverrideOrdinal
[FIX] Center data when range is zero for PickScale()
[FIX] remake font based on actual prior font size instead of persistent field
[FIX] modify XDate docs to explain Excel date bug
[NEW] add SampleMultiPointList class to illustrate IPointList usage
[NEW] demo pane with four y axes
[NEW] StickItemDemo, several Bars with Labels demos

22-Nov-2005 (by softlion)
[UPD] Updated Web sample in C# to work with new RenderMode option
[FIX] Minor bug fix introduced in 21-nov-2005 version
[FIX] Workaround for .NET File.GetCreationTime method's bug.

21-Nov-2005 (by softlion)
[FIX] Caching with new rendering mode was not working as expected.
[NEW] The generated image tag has now a querystring to defeat browser caching mechanism when an update is needed.
[NEW] ColorOpacity property in "Fill" structures. We should created a new Color selector designer with the ability to set the color alpha channel instead, but this is a quick start.
[NEW] Added and updated some comments

19-Nov-2005 (by softlion)
  Major changes to the web interface:
  DataSource property works. Optional DataSource are also available on each curve, by default it uses the main DataSource. DataMember property is available as a main property for the base axis (x axis) and as a property on each curve (y axis).
  New RenderMode property to render as an IMG tag instead of generating and returning an image on the fly. A temporary image file is created and saved in the folder specified by the new RenderedImagePath property. The file name is the control ID (may change in a near future).
  Comments uptdated and added on properties
  Property categories change for readability (ASP.NET pages made with previous version will need to upgrade)
  Major and minor grid properties for all axis are now grouped into a child item
  minor bug fix: image generated on the fly also sends HTML IMG tag
